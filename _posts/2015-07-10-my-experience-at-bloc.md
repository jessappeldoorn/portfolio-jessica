title: My Experience at Bloc
---
It wasn't until I made my first "About Me" webpage; which was super basic, but oh-so-fun, that I thought about seriously making a career change. While I love architecture and design, I was feeling a need to create something that could reach a broader audience, something that most people use and appreciate; something that could also still be 'thoughtfully designed' and useful. Then I thought about what qualities and skills I possess:  

* I'm creative, but I love technical too
* My decisions and thought process tend to be logical and I'm inherently organized
* Naturally, I'm a focused person with an acute attention to detail

Once I considered out all of this, I decided to take a risk and leave my current job to pursue something new. I looked into a number of different options for developing my skills, and even tried a few - that weren't right for me.  In the end, I chose Bloc, because it would allow me to work 1x1 with a mentor while completing the program and building my portfolio of work. 

The coursework started with a long series of lessons that built up my understanding of the front-end languange Javascript. I had a fairly difficult time grasping it, but this is common and I kept that in mind. It was easy to test my solutions using Mocha and Chai and I found that the more I practiced the more it sank in. I supplemented the coursework alot, with many other materials including (but not limited to) books and sites to practice on:

* Udemy courses on Angular and JS
* TalentBuddy
* Codewars
* Treehouse
* Code Academy
* JS101 
* Eloquent Javascript
* Javascript: The Good Parts

I soon moved on to building my first web app in AngularJS. Everything was moving quickly, and then it was onto more and more projects. Through the program, I ended up building a handful of web applications and webites; and this is the basis of the program - to get stuff built.  

While I didn't know it at the time, this program is designed to get you building things fast! The program is geared toward putting things into practice. By doing this, you start to see patterns and remember how things are working; it's up to you to learn the ins and outs. But often, this is a process, in any field. Just keep buiding stuff!
