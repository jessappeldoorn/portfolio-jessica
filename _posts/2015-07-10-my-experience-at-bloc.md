title: My Experience at Bloc
---
It wasn't until I made my first "About Me" webpage, which was super basic (but oh-so-fun), that I thought about seriously making a career change to web development. While I love architecture and design, I was feeling a need to create something that could reach a broader audience, something that people deliberately use and appreciate; something that could also still be 'thoughtfully designed' and useful. Then I thought about what qualities and skills I possess:  

* I'm creative, but I love technical too
* My decisions and thought process tend to be logical and I'm inherently organized
* Naturally, I'm a focused person with an acute attention to detail

Once I considered this, I decided to take a risk and leave my job to pursue something new (and super challenging)! I looked into a number of different options for developing my programming skills, and even tried a few - that weren't right for me.  In the end, I chose Bloc, because it would allow me to work 1x1 with a mentor while completing the program and building my portfolio of work. Mentor meetings happened 3x week; and I have to say, this is the most rewarding part of the program. Talking through your solutions and learning by example is an important compenent of learning and building confidence.  

My 'roadmap' of learning, started with a long series of lessons that built up my understanding of the front-end languange Javascript. I had a fairly difficult time grasping it, but this is common and I kept that in mind. It was easy to test my solutions using Mocha and Chai and I found that the more I practiced the more it sank in. I supplemented the coursework ALOT, with many other materials including (but not limited to) books and sites to practice on:

* Udemy courses on Angular and JS
* The Harvard CS50 course available on YouTube
* TalentBuddy
* Codewars
* Treehouse
* Code Academy
* JS101 
* Eloquent Javascript
* Javascript: The Good Parts
* And many more...

I soon started building my first web app in AngularJS. Everything was moving quickly, and then it was onto more and more projects. Throughout the program, I ended up building a handful of web applications and webites; and this is the basis of Bloc - to get you building things fast! The program is geared toward putting things into practice, with the end goal being tangible results. By doing this, you start to see patterns and remember how things are working; it's up to you to learn the ins and outs. But often, this is a process, in any field. Just keep building stuff! I've come so far in such a little time, that I'd say it was worth it!
