title: My Experience at Bloc
---
<!-- My first experience with coding was a result of my husbands encouragment; he's always been interested in technology and believes that everyone should learn to code. I never thought about it really, until one day, in the not-so-distant past, I attended an info session at General Assembly for Web Development. I left feeling so energized and motivated. I made my first "About Me" webpage; which was super basic, but oh-so-fun!  I had never thought about seriously making a career change, but at that moment in time it seemed like the answer I had been searching for.  While I love architecture and design, I was feeling a need to create something that could reach a broader audience, perhaps I could create something that people would want to use; something that could also still be 'thoughtfully designed'. Then I started to realize that this new career would be a good idea, because:  

* I'm creative, but I absolutely love the technical
* My decisions and thought process tend to be logical and I'm inherently organized
* Naturally, I'm a focused person with an acute attention to detail

Once I figured out all of this, I had no other option but to go for it. I decided to take a huge risk and leave my job in architecture. I looked into a number of different options for developing my skills, and even tried a few - that weren't right for me.  In the end, I chose the Bloc Apprenticeship, because it would allow me to work 1x1 with a mentor while completing the coursework. I was so lucky to be able to chose an awesome developer in Seattle, which was really convenient, considering Bloc has mentors all over the world! 

The coursework started with a long series of lessons that built up my understanding of Javascript. I had a fairly difficult time grasping it all, but this is common and I kept that in mind. It was easy to test my solutions using Mocha and Chai. I soon moved on to building my first web app in AngularJS. Everything was moving quickly, and then it was onto the next projects. Through the program, I ended up building a number of web applications and sites; and this is the basis of the program - build stuff.  

While I didn't know it at the time, I had the confidence to build stuff! While concepts are touched on, the program is mainly geared toward putting things into practice. By doing this, eventually you start to see some patterns and remember how things are working. 

> I can build some shit!

I have the foundation now to build upon. I continue to practice everything I've learned and add additional skills. -->
