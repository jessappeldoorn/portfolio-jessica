title: Goals, as a Front-End Developer
---
<!-- When I decided I wanted to make a career shift and I dove in, I wasn't doubting my abilities or worrying how I would compare to the competition; I was just super excited to discover my new found interest in web development. Actually, I felt pretty confidant in my design abilities and I was really looking forward to learning how to code. I felt (and feel) very strongly that I can, and will be, good at this; with time and practice. It wasn't until I started attending some 'hiring' events where I was surrounded by hundreds of people with computer science degrees talking about C++ and other things I couldn't quite have conversations about.  I started to feel really out of place and started to question if I could really do this.   -->
