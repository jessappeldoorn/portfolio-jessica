I am a front-end web developer with a background in architecture. With my understanding of built space, I'm passionate about developing and designing applications that interact with our digital & physical environment; I use my inherent design skills to build responsive web applications that look great and feel awesome to use. I am very interested in the way we interact with our surroundings and with technology. I code alot, cook alot, love the outdoors, the french language, and whale... to name a few.  I care deeply about health and wellness.
