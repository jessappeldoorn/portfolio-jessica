![Jessica Appeldoorn]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/jess_hello.jpg)

I am a front-end web developer with a background in interior architecture. With my understanding of built space and human emotion, I'm passionate about developing and designing applications that help users interact with our digital & physical environment more elegantly. I use my inherent design skills to build responsive web applications that look great and feel awesome to use. I am very interested in the way we interact with our surroundings, eachother, and with technology. I love learning new things and experimenting, I cook alot, love the outdoors, the french language, and whales, to name a few.  I also care deeply about the environment and health and wellness. Thank you for checking out my work!
