## Explanation

To-do lists are notorious for collecting junk - tasks that you want to remember, but constantly reprioritize. To solve the problem of to-do list clutter, list.it will manage your to-do lists by automatically deleting tasks that have not been completed after seven days; after-all, if your task is not important enough to be completed in seven days, it doesn't belong on your to-do list.  

## Use Case
To-do lists are notorious for collecting junk - tasks that you want to remember but constantly reprioritize. To solve the problem of to-do list clutter, I built List.it, a project I implemented while studying through the web development bootcamp, Bloc, Inc. List.it is a web application that manages your to-do lists by automatically deleting tasks that have not been completed after seven days.

If the task is not important enough to be completed within seven days, it does not belong on your to-do list.


## Solution

Syncing tasks with a persistent backend; seeing active tasks in a default view; removing tasks that are either complete or expired to a different view, which is hidden from the main view; adding descriptions and priority level to each task; markng tasks complete; mobile friendly interface, touch gestures, authentication, multiple lists.
