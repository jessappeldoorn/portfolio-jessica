## Explanation

Pulse & Pause is a web application built to help users track their time working on projects; it's based on the Pomodoro Technique. It includes 3 timers: Work, Short Break, and Long Break. The app was built using AngularJS, HTML5, SASS(CSS3) with Bootstrap, the Firebase API and Grunt.

## Use Case

The Pomodoro Technique aims to increase your work productivity and quality. In its simplest form, you time your work in 25-minute intervals, with five-minute breaks in between.

During a 25-minute session, you focus on a task. Checking email, answering the phone, or browsing your favorite forum is not allowed. During a break, you do not do anything related to work. You can meditate, do push-ups and play with your dog, but you can't think about work.

When implemented with discipline, Pulse & Pause can be a powerful tool to help increase your productivity. I built this application as part of my coursework through the Bloc, Inc. Web Development Program.

## Solution

I decided that the most important element of the app was the timer, so I wanted to showcase this. A user can start using the timer immediately, without having to jump around the site.  As the page loads, the timer displays itself and automatically alternates between work and rest periods. As an added feature, I wanted to allow the user to save their tasks and track their time through a dashboard; this requires a user to login.
